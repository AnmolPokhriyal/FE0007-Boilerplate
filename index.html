      <h1>Ardiuno</h1>
      <p><em>Arduino</em> is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware
        and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a
        finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating
        a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your
        board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on
        the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring),
        and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.</p>
      <p>Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool
        for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and
        programming. </p>

      <h1>Respberry Pi</h1>
      <p>The <em>Raspberry Pi</em> is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs
        into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
        It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore
        computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.
        It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from
        browsing the internet and playing high-definition
        video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.</p>
      <p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a registered educational charity
        (registration number 1129409) based in the UK. Our Foundation’s goal
        is to advance the education of adults and children, particularly in the
        field of computers, computer science and related subjects.
        See our stories page for more information about the Foundation’s charitable work. </p>

      <h1>Giant Board</h1>
      <p>The <em>Giant Board</em> is the first-ever single-board computer (SBC) to come in the
        Adafruit Feather form factor, and this a serious piece of OSHW that’s made to
        take advantage of Adafruit's Blinka libraries for CircuitPython. The Giant
        Board also comes preloaded with Debian Linux, and reflashing it with Nerves
        is going to push our favorite embedded Linux platform into a whole new arena.

      <h1>BeagleBone Black</h1>
      <p>Another <em>BeagleBoard product</em>, the Black was one of Nerves’ first targets because it
        has so many features that are attractive for IoT development. Besides its open source
        status, we like to use the Black and Black Wireless because they offer great performance.
        Everything that was said about the BeagleBone Green holds here minus Ethernet + Wi-Fi/BT on a single board.</p>

      <h1>SeeedStudio NPi i.MX6ULL Dev Board </h1>
      <p>The last board on our list also brings something unique to the table:
        the i.MX6 Applications Processor, a unique chip that’s tailored towards multimedia
        devices that utilize sound, video, voice, pictures, and touch. This processor can
        handle up to HD 1080p encode and decode, 3D video playback in high definition,
        and HD 1080p videoconferencing, giving it a unique position in the MCU marketplace.</p>
      <p>The dev board in particular boasts 2x 100Mb Ethernet ports, 24-bit RGB display interface,
        a Raspberry Pi expansion header, and a secondary 40 position GPIO header. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Development kits are at the heart of any agile IoT project, and that’s why
      it’s so important to weigh all the options and choose the right one for the job.
      By making the right decision, we can cut costs, reduce time to market, and build in all the features that we want.</p>
